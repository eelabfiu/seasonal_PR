This repository contains methylation AFLP data as employed in Rodr√≠guez-Casariego et al., Frontiers in Marine Sciences, 2020: "Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis reveals a conserved epigenetic response to seasonal environmental variation in the staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis"
Variables.csv: Dataset including all experimental variables (Collection time, Site, Genotype, Depth, Source, Fragment) for each studied sample (P001 onwards)
GenotypeData.csv contains the raw results of microsatellite analysis for genotype determination.  
MSAPdataTime.csv is the absence-presence methylation AFLP curated dataset employed for the analysis in the aforementioned manuscript, being the first column collection time, the second one IDs for each coral fragment (P001, P002...) and the third one each enzyme sensitive to DNA methylation (HpaII and MspI). The subsequent columns are each methylation loci. This dataset has been adapted to https://github.com/anpefi/msap
irmonth.csv, RegionalTemp.csv and PRenv_monthYSI.csv contain summarized environmental data for the study region.

Details on the R scripts and packages employed can be obtained from the Authors upon request
